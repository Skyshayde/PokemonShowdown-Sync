# PokemonShowdown-Sync
Chrome extension to synchronize Pokemon Showdown teams.  I'm pretty sure it works right now but I need to iron out a bunch of bugs before it is finished.  

## Usage

call the function syncTeams() in the dev console to synchronize.  There is a button for it, but it only appears when you refresh the page on the teambuilder.
